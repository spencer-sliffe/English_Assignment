    	<h1>Poverty in the United States of America</h1>
		<div>
			<p>-According to the Census, in 2020 over 37 million people lived in poverty.</br>
			</br>-Food insecurity and hunger are economic issues. The most common cause of food insecurity is a lower income.</br>
			</br>-11.4% of people in the United States experience poverty</br>
			</br>-1 in 6 children lived in poverty in 2020</br>
			</br>-Making ends meet with a lower income is more difficult if you are unemployed or employed in low-wage work, experience a financial</br> 			emergency, have limited savings, and rent rather than own your home.</br>
			</br>-Communities of color, especially Black communities, experience hunger, poverty, and unemployment at much higher rates than white 			people.</br> This is because of long-standing racial injustice that leads to barriers in education, employment, housing, and more.</br>
